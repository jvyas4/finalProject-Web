          Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered
          gameboard called a chessboard. The game is believed to have originated
          in India in the 6th century and has since spread around the world.
          Each player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two
          rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The goal of the game
          is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means putting it into a
          position where it is under attack and cannot escape capture. Chess is
          a game of skill, strategy, and tactics, and is enjoyed by millions of
          people around the world.

          The origin of chess is believed to be in ancient India, where a game
          called chaturanga was played in the 6th century. Chaturanga was a
          strategic game that included pieces representing infantry, cavalry,
          elephants, and chariots, and a king that had to be protected at all
          costs. The game spread to Persia, where it underwent significant
          changes, including the introduction of new pieces and a board with 64
          squares.
