          The origin of chess is believed to be in ancient India, where a game
          called chaturanga was played in the 6th century. Chaturanga was a
          strategic game that included pieces representing infantry, cavalry,
          elephants, and chariots, and a king that had to be protected at all
          costs. The game spread to Persia, where it underwent significant
          changes, including the introduction of new pieces and a board with 64
          squares.

    <h2 class="mainHeading">The Rules</h2>
    <!-- rules of how to play the game -->

    <ul class="rulesContainer" type="1">
      <li class="singleRule">
        1. The game is played on a square board with 64 squares, arranged in an 8x8
        grid.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        2. Each player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two
        rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        3. The pieces are arranged on the board as follows: the two rooks go in the
        corners, then the knights next to them, followed by the bishops, and
        then the queen, who always goes on her own matching color. The king goes
        in the remaining square.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        4. The player with the white pieces moves first, and then players take
        turns making one move at a time.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        5. Each piece has its own unique way of moving, and these movements are
        determined by the type of piece.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        6. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, which
        means that the king is under attack (in check) and cannot escape capture
        on the next move.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        7. A player can also win the game by the opponent resigning or by the game
        being declared a draw.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        8. There are several special moves in chess, including castling, en
        passant, and promotion, which involve moving multiple pieces at once or
        changing the rank or file of a pawn.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        9. A game can be won, lost, or drawn in various ways, and these outcomes
        are determined by the final position of the pieces on the board.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- the tips -->
    <h2 class="mainHeading">The Tips</h2>
    <ul class="tipsContainer">
      <li class="singleRule">
        1. Control the center of the board: The center of the board is the most
        important area of the chessboard. Controlling the center with your
        pieces can give you a significant advantage in the game.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        2. Develop your pieces: Move your pieces out from their starting positions
        and develop them towards the center of the board. This allows you to
        control more squares and put pressure on your opponent.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        3. Protect your king: Always make sure your king is safe and not exposed to
        any potential attacks. Castle early in the game to get your king to a
        safer position.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        4. Look for your opponent's weaknesses: Keep an eye out for your opponent's
        weaknesses and try to exploit them. This could be an unprotected piece,
        a weak pawn structure, or a poorly placed king.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        5. Plan your moves ahead: Try to think several moves ahead and plan your
        strategy accordingly. This helps you to anticipate your opponent's
        responses and make more informed decisions.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        6. Use tactics and combinations: Learn and practice chess tactics such as
        forks, pins, and skewers. These can help you win material and gain an
        advantage in the game.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        7. Maintain the initiative: Try to maintain the initiative in the game by
        keeping your opponent on the defensive and forcing them to react to your
        moves.
      </li>
      <li class="singleRule">
        8. Keep your cool: Stay calm and focused during the game, and avoid making
        impulsive moves. Chess is a game of patience and strategy, so take your
        time and think carefully before making a move.
